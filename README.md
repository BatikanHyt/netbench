NetBench is a stress testing tool for servers written in Go programming language. Its purpose is to simulate heavy traffic loads on servers to identify potential performance issues. NetBench currently supports HTTP protocol, and **is a project I am working on to learn Go programming language.**

## Features

- Sends multiple HTTP requests simultaneously
